<p>I am working as a senior data scientist at JustEat Takeaway on large scale search and recommender systems. I have been focussing on both research and engineering aspects of
large scale information retrieval systems, using state of the art techniques. I have also been working on removing various sorts of biases from ranking lists.
  I have built and productionalized implicit matrix factorisation for personalised restaurant recommendations using SageMaker,
    which has been used to replace popularity based baseline in personalized restaurant emails. Additionally,
    I have built a POC for personalised restaurant recommendations using Factorisation Machines.
    In addition to this, I worked on unbiased learning to ranking by building a position-bias corrected click-through-rate using search logs.
