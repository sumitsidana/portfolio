<p>Currently, I work as a data scientist at Wolt.</p>
<p>
  Prior to this, I worked as a senior data scientist at Delivery Hero in ranking and personalization team. I collaborated on a machine learning-driven cross-sell project, emphasizing product ranking. I conducted extensive exploratory data analysis on cross-sell events and developed models for recommending complementary products. I oversaw end-to-end deployment of these models and designed offline metrics that correlated with online performance indicators. Additionally, I effectively managed stakeholder relationships throughout the project.

<p>Previously, I worked as a senior data scientist at JustEat Takeaway on large scale search and recommender systems. I have been focussing on both research and engineering aspects of
large scale information retrieval systems, using state of the art techniques. I have also been working on removing various sorts of biases from ranking lists.
  I have built and productionalized implicit matrix factorisation for personalised restaurant recommendations using SageMaker,
    which has been used to replace popularity based baseline in personalized restaurant emails. Additionally,
    I have built a POC for personalised restaurant recommendations using Factorisation Machines.
    In addition to this, I worked on unbiased learning to rank by building a position-bias corrected click-through-rate using search logs.
  Finally, I worked on counterfactual off-policy evaluation (OPE) of general purpose ranking lists.

<p>
I obtained my Ph.D. in recommender sytems in online advertising from <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/">University Grenoble Alpes</a>,
a prestigious university in Grenoble, France.
My Ph.D. thesis was supervised by Prof. <a href="http://ama.liglab.fr/~amini/">Massih-Reza Amini</a> and co-supervised by Assoc Prof.
<a href="https://laclauc.github.io/">Charlotte Laclau</a>,
on recommender systems in online advertising.
